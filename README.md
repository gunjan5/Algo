# AlGo

- Practice algo implementation in Golang

- Goal is to implement some challenge and then optimize it's performance by using better data structures and/or algorithms (maybe use goroutines for a few solutions but that's not the goal of this repo)

- Calculate runtime and memory efficiency for all the solutions
